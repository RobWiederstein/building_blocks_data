# Building Blocks -- Data Warehouse

We are a data-driven, not-for-profit organized to benefit children and their families in southern Indiana. Frequently used, public data sets are maintained in this repository for download by similarly minded providers, families, employers, schools and civic leaders. Where data sets have been copied from another source, attribution, acknowledgement and credit is given in the `readme.md` within that specific directory.
